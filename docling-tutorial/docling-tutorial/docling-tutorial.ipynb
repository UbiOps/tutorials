    "# Deploy Docling Serve on UbiOps with Docker and Services\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will deploy IBM's Docling Serve document processing server on UbiOps using a custom Docker image. We'll expose the server through UbiOps Services, which allows direct HTTP access to the Docling API endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What are UbiOps Services?\n",
    "\n",
    "[UbiOps Services](https://ubiops.com/docs/services/) let you expose your deployments through custom HTTP endpoints. Unlike standard UbiOps deployment endpoints that follow the UbiOps API request/response structure, Services enable you to send direct HTTP requests to your deployments. This is particularly useful when combined with our [bring your own Docker image](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/docker-support/) feature, as it allows you to deploy a range of server-based application such as Docling Serve, Ollama, or custom servers built with Flask, FastAPI, and others and expose it directly via a service.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll use a pre-built Docker image from the [Docling Serve project](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve) and expose it directly via a Service. Services provide automatic HTTPS and TLS certificate provisioning, load balancing across deployment replicas, and integration with UbiOps monitoring, logging, and permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Docling?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Docling](https://github.com/DS4SD/docling) is an advanced document processing toolkit developed by IBM Research that can parse and convert various document formats including PDF, DOCX, PPTX, images, HTML, and more into structured formats like Markdown and JSON. It provides high-quality document understanding capabilities including layout analysis, table extraction, optical character recognition (OCR), and document structure detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Docling Serve?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Docling Serve](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve) is a FastAPI-based REST API server that wraps Docling's document processing capabilities. It provides endpoints for converting documents, checking server health, and managing processing jobs. The server is containerized and ready to deploy with Docker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We will set up a connection with UbiOps, create a custom [environment](https://ubiops.com/docs/environments/) with the Docling Serve Docker image, create a [deployment](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/) that runs the Docling server, create a Service to expose the Docling API, and test document processing with various file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll use the official [Docling Serve Docker image](https://github.com/docling-project/docling-serve). To follow along, ensure you have [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed locally to pull and save the image, and that your UbiOps subscription has access to custom environments."

    "\n",
    "For accessing authenticated endpoints like `/docs` or `/ui` (we have enabled the UI playground by using environment variable `DOCLING_SERVE_ENABLE_UI=1`) in your browser, you can use browser extension tools such as [Requestly](https://requestly.com/) to automatically inject authentication headers into requests. These tool will allow you to configure rules that add your Authorization header to all requests going to your service URL, enabling interaction with the Swagger UI documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing API Documentation with Browser Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "The Docling Serve API documentation is available at `/swagger`, `/docs`, and `/scalar` endpoints. However, since authentication is required at the UbiOps Service level, you'll need to inject the Authorization header using a browser extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Requestly Browser Extension\n",
    "\n",
    "[Requestly](https://requestly.io/) is a browser extension (available for Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that allows you to modify HTTP headers for specific URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Install the Requestly extension for your browser\n",
    "2. Choose HTTP Interceptor > Modify headers\n",
    "3. Configure the rule so that it includes your service URL ('services.ubiops.com')\n",
    "4. Add a Request Header and choose 'authorization', fill the Header Value with the UbiOps token in the form 'Token ...'\n",
    "5. Save the rule\n",
    "6. You can now navigate to the endpoints in your browser \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example configuration:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "URL Pattern: your-service-id.services.ubiops.com\n",
    "Header Name: Authorization\n",
    "Header Value: Token your-api-token-here\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once configured, you can access:\n",
    "- ReDoc: `{SERVICE_URL}/docs`\n",
    "- Scalar: `{SERVICE_URL}/scalar`\n",
    "- Docling serve UI: `{SERVICE_URL}/ui` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The exact workflow for creating rules differs per browser and Requestly version. Refer to [Requestly's documentation](https://docs.requestly.com/general/getting-started/introduction) for browser-specific instructions."
