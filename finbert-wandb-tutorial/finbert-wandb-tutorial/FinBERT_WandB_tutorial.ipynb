    "FinBERT, a pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) model, is designed to assess the sentiment of financial text. It is built by training the BERT language model in the finance domain on a substantial financial dataset. In this example, we will fine-tune it on a custom dataset. The model provides softmax outputs corresponding to three labels: positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This model can be used through the library of HuggingFace `transformers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to use the UbiOps platform to fine-tune FinBERT on different hyperparameter configurations on a financial news dataset, in parallel, in the cloud, using CPUs. FinBERT is a generic model, thus one would also want to further fine-tune it on their own datasets. We will do three training jobs to find the best combination of hyperparameters, thus finding the best training flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the training jobs are running, we head over to Weights & Biases to analyze performance metrics during our training runs, and to compare the final models. After checking the accuracy metrics of all three training runs, we will store our best performing ML model on the Weights & Biases Model Registry, and deploy it by turning it into a live and scalable API endpoint on UbiOps. The model can be conveniently exposed to end-users via the API endpoint in a production set-up, allowing it to scale, depending on the demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a paid subscription account, you may upgrade your CPU instance to a GPU instance (e.g. `instance_type = 16384mb_t4`)! You would also need to select an environment with CUDA compiled. More on this matter can be read [here](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/gpu-deployments/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The FinBERT model can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) and the dataset [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Jean-Baptiste/financial_news_sentiment).\n",
    "The dataset we use is from the HuggingFace `datasets` library, and it consists of ~2000 Canadian news articles with manually validated financial sentiment. It also has a topic label, which can be used for further experiments!"
