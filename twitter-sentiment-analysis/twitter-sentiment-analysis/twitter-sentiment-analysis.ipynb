    "- Connect with the Twitter API to collect tweets.\n",

    "- Connect with your own Google sheet file to push results to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of scope for this notebook, but relevant, is the visualisation in Tableau (that reads from google sheets as a database).\n",

    "If you run this entire notebook after filling in the Twitter access tokens and the Google sheets id, all required connections are set up and the model will start building. You can check via your UbiOps WebApp when the deployment has finished building, so that it's ready for requests. \n",
    "You can also check the individual steps in this notebook to see what we did exactly and how you can adapt it to your own use case, e.g. changing the hashtag. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to run the cells step by step, as some cells can take a some times to finish. You can run everything in one go as well and it will work, just allow a few minutes for building the deployment.\n"
