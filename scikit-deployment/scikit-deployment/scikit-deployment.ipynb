    "In this notebook we will show you the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to make a training pipeline in UbiOps which preprocesses the data and trains and tests a model using scikit\n",
    "- How to make a production pipeline in UbiOps which takes in new data, processes it and feeds it to a trained model for prediction/classification\n",
    "\n",
    "For this example we will use a diabetes dataset from Kaggle to create a KNN classifier to predict if someone will have diabetes or not. [Link to original dataset](https://kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this entire notebook after filling in your access token, the two pipelines and all the necessary models will be deployed to your UbiOps environment. You can thus check your environment after running to explore. You can also check the individual steps in this notebook to see what we did exactly and how you can adapt it to your own use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to run the cells step by step, as some cells can take a few minutes to finish. You can run everything in one go as well and it will work, just allow a few minutes for building the individual deployments.\n",

    "## Establishing a connection with your UbiOps environment\n",
    "Add your API token. Then we will provide a project name, deployment name and deployment version name. Afterwards we connect to the UbiOps API, which allows us to create deployments and pipelines in our project. This way we can deploy the two pipelines to your environment."
