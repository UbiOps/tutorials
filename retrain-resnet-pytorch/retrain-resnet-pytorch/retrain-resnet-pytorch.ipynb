    "# Retrain ResNet using PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we show how to retrain a PyTorch model on UbiOps. In this end-to-end example, we first set-up an `Environment` in which our training jobs can run. Then we define a `train.py` script that we can apply to our `Environment`. The training script imports ResNet with pretrained weights and retrains that model on the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html). Finally, we benchmark its performance on the test set, and add that as a `metric` to our output. Snippets from this workflow can be used to retrain your own models.\n",
