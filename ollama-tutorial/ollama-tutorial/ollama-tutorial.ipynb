    "# Deploy an Open-AI compatible Ollama inference server on UbiOps\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will explain how to run LLMs supported by Ollama on UbiOps. Developers distribute Ollama by publishing a custom `install.sh` [script](https://ollama.com/download). This script allows creating custom Docker images with Ollama by running `install.sh` in a `Dockerfile`. We will create a custom environment based on a UbiOps base environment (so that it [supports the requests format](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/docker-support/#supporting-request-format)) and deploy it using the [bring-your-own-image](https://ubiops.com/docs/environments/#bring-your-own-docker-image) feature. Finally, we will make requests to Ollama server using Ubiops `requests` and OpenAI [python package](https://pypi.org/project/openai/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've completed this tutorial, you'll be able to successfully run an OpenAI-compatible Ollama inference server on UbiOps. If you're looking to take things a step further and host multiple Ollama models within a single deployment, be sure to check out our [Multi-Model Ollama Hosting](https://ubiops.com/docs/ubiops_tutorials/ollama-multi-model-hosting/ollama-multi-model-hosting/) tutorial.\n"

    "## 2. Creating a custom environment\n",
    "\n",
    "For our Ollama deployment, we need to create a custom environment by uploading a Docker image to UbiOps. UbiOps has the [bring-your-own-image](https://ubiops.com/docs/environments/#bring-your-own-docker-image) feature, allowing you to upload custom Docker containers as environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you upload a Docker image as a [custom environment](https://ubiops.com/docs/environments/#create-a-custom-environment) in UbiOps, the platform treats it as any other environment that can be selected when creating deployment versions. The image can either be set up to support the standard UbiOps [request format](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/docker-support/#supporting-request-format) , or it can be a non-request format (service) deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our goal of serving an Ollama model, we want to use the standard UbiOps [request format](https://ubiops.com/docs/deployments/docker-support/#supporting-request-format). This allows us to leverage more of of the platforms features, including automatic scaling based on incoming requests, detailed logging, and the ability to connect our model to other services using UbiOps Pipelines. To use the request format functionality with a custom Docker image, it is a key requirement that our image is based on an official UbiOps deployment image. This is because the base image contains the necessary agent that handles the communication with the UbiOps platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this and make our Docker image compatible, we will need the following prerequisites:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Docker**: Install [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) on your machine\n",
    "- **UbiOps Base Image**: Access to UbiOps base environment images (contact your account manager or [support portal](https://support.ubiops.com) if unavailable). You will either receive access to a registry, or a single image tar file. It is important to use the base image provided by UbiOps because it includes an agent implementation. This agent is what handles the UbiOps request format and starts your deployment code when a request arrives."
