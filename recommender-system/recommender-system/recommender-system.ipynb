    "# Deploying a recommender model\n",
    "**Note**: This notebook runs on Python 3.11 and uses UbiOps CLient Library 3.15.0. It is used in [this blogpost](https://ubiops.com/how-to-build-and-implement-a-recommendation-system-from-scratch-in-python/).\n",

    "In this notebook we will show you the following:\n",
    "- how to train a recommender model on shopping data using [the Apriori algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apriori_algorithm)\n",
    "- How to deploy that model to UbiOps\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender models are everywhere nowadays. At every webshop you will receive suggestions based on products you have viewed or added to your shopping cart. In this notebook we will make such a recommender model that can be used in the backend of a webshop. We will use the Apriori algorithm to find rules that describe associations between different products given 7500 transactions over the course of a week at a French retail store. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y5DYn0dGoSbC22xowBq2d4po6h1JxcTQ/view).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run this entire notebook after filling in your access token, the model is trained and deployed to your UbiOps environment. You can thus check your environment after running to explore. You can also check the individual steps in this notebook to see what we did exactly and how you can adapt it to your own use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend to run the cells step by step, as some cells can take a few minutes to finish. You can run everything in one go as well and it will work, just allow a few minutes for building the individual deployments."
