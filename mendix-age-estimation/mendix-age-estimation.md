This deployment is made for running a neural network model developed with ONNX. Be aware that the model weight file is 
not included and needs to be downloaded separately before uploading this deployment package to UbiOps. See the download link below.

This deployment is part of an article: 
[Building a low code app powered by AI](https://ubiops.com/building-a-low-code-app-powered-by-ai/)

Please read the article for more information on how this model was used in practice in the background of a low-code Mendix app.
